# Gift List

This GiftList project is second week assignment from Alchemy University Ethereum Dev. Bootcamp. Essentially the goal of this project is to show how merkle tree works to check if one input name is included inside a bunch of namelist.

Here are the step to run this application:

## 1. Install the dependancy packages

```bash
npm install
```

## 2. Run the server

Write this command code on the terminal:

```bash
node server/index.js
```

## 3. Run and check if your name is in the list for the gift!

```bash
node client/index.js "<name>"
```

I've set the name input to be dynamically changeable with `process.argv`. Don't forget to use quotation mark.
